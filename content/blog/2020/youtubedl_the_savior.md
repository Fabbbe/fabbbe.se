youtube-dl might at first seem like a neat tool to download some of your favorite videos to watch while you're offline, but it can be much more than that.

For me this realization started when I found [youtube-dl's website](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/index.html) where they have listed the all the [sites they support](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/supportedsites.html). It is a huge list which I recommend for everyone to read because it includes a lot of sites that you might not expect. The supported sites includes sites like YouTube (of course), Twitch.tv both live streams and videos, a lot of news sites, sites that offer full series and episodes and even regional content like the BBC (although that is often region-blocked).

It is possible to use youtube-dl as a sort-of VCR that makes it download a live streams for you to watch later by just entering `youtube-dl <LIVESTREAM-URL>`. But what if you want to watch things like on a normal TV without downloading them? Well, you could do it on your web browser while letting it eat up lots of memory and letting Google ingest most of your data, but there is a better way. There is a small, GUI-light video-player called [MPV](https://mpv.io/) which can be built with youtube-dl support, meaning that you can input a URL from any of the supported websites to play it immediately, skipping all Google or Amazon services to give you the video directly from their servers. 

In conclusion, youtube-dl and MPV can be a large help with letting you watch youtube without using (and supporting) Google services and ad services. When you avoid the web browser you're also able to avoid using the huge amount of resources that they use.
